# State

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-17
**Current Work:** **agent-task-context — EXECUTED** on `feature/agent-task-context` (1 commit, ACTX-01..04). Two post-v2 tweaks to the Agents direction, renderer-only: (1) agent rail cards (`SessionCard`) + session detail strip (`SessionDetail`) now show the linked ADO task — title + `type`/`state` pills — when the session's worktree branch carries a *pinned* task ID, via new `linkedPinFor(tasks, taskId)` join helper in `session-attribution.ts` (first-match-wins, mirrors App.tsx `linkedPin`); bare `#id`/`detached`/`path missing` fallbacks unchanged; link stays **derived, never stored**. (2) "Open worktree" button in the session detail top bar (`agents-detail-bar`) jumps to Tree direction with that worktree selected (`setSelectedId(session.cwd)` + `direction:'tree'`; `WorktreeNode.id === path === cwd`), landing on the "Open with" launchers incl. Visual Studio 2022 — shown only when attributed to a live worktree (`!detached && !pathMissing`). `tasks={tasks.tasks}` + `onOpenWorktree` threaded App→AgentsView→SessionRail/SessionDetail. `.task-pill` set duplicated into `SessionRail.css` + `AgentsView.css` (per-component convention). No new IPC, no `SessionView` shape change. **Gate green: typecheck (0 err) + lint (0 err; 17 pre-existing smoke-script warnings) + 183 tests + `electron-vite build`.** **PR #47 opened** (`feature/agent-task-context` → main, `Closes #46`). **Remaining:** hand-verify in dev post-merge (needs a registered workspace + a pinned task whose ID matches a worktree branch). (Prior: M5 COMPLETE — entire v2 roadmap shipped.)

**Prior Current Work:** **M5 COMPLETE — entire v2 roadmap shipped to `main`.** All three sub-milestones merged: AM1 Agent Spike (PR #39), AM2 Agent Sessions (PR #41, `Closes #40`), AM3 Agent Config & Integration (PR #44, `Closes #43`). Also landed since AM2: `feature/app-icons` (PR #42, Playground marks replacing the default Electron icon) and the README rewrite + screenshots (PR #45, `docs/repo-presentation`). Working tree clean; **no open PRs; no active feature work queued.** With M1–M4 (v1) + worktree-name-template (post-v1) + M5 (v2) all on `main`, the planned roadmap through v2 is done. **Remaining loose threads (both user-run, can sit indefinitely):** (1) the carried-over **T10 manual end-to-end release check** (throwaway `v0.0.1`/`v0.0.2` → silent auto-update, nightly ×2 → single rolling pre-release, stable never offered nightly, cleanup) — still unchecked; (2) **AGCF-05** remove-worktree-vs-running confirm + visual colour/theme-toggle — hand-verify only, code merged, needs a registered workspace + worktree. **Next planned work = v3** (task→agent auto-briefing, agent-activity notifications, ADO writes — all parked in ROADMAP "Future Considerations" / Deferred Ideas). (Prior: AM3 agent-config PR #44.)

**Prior Current Work:** **M5 AM3 "Agent Config & Integration" — EXECUTED T1–T11** on `feature/agent-config` (11 commits, AGCF-01..08). Promote-don't-rewrite held: `buildSpawnPlan`/`PtyPort`/`SessionRingBuffer`/`TerminalPane`/AD-004 channels reused unchanged; `SEEDED_AGENTS` demoted to the `DEFAULT_CONFIG.agents` seed. **New:** pure `buildRawSpawnPlan` (+5 tests) · grown `SessionManager` (config-sourced agents, `ui.defaultShell`, ad-hoc, rename/duplicate, retained-buffer `lastOutput`; +10 tests) · only-new IPC `sessions:rename`/`:duplicate` (+ widened `sessions:spawn` w/ `adhocCommand?`) · `SettingsDialog` Coding-agents + Default-shell sections (live `config:patch`) · `NewSessionDialog` ad-hoc chip · `SessionRail` concurrency banner (≥4) + per-agent tile colour + ANSI-stripped 2-line preview · `AgentsView` rename pencil + Duplicate + tile colour · new renderer-orchestrated `RemoveWorktreeConfirm` (stop[]→remove) · App threads `config.agents` + rename/duplicate. New renderer libs `agent-color.ts` + `ansi.ts`; `pencil` Icon; `AgentDef`/`Shell` re-exported from `shared/agents`. AGCF-07 confirmed already shipped in AM2 (only tile colour new; TerminalPane comment de-staled). **Automated gate green: typecheck + lint (0 err) + 183 tests (was 168→183: +5 spawn-plan, +10 session-manager; 2 config-store ui-shape assertions updated for the grown `ui`) + `electron-vite build`.** Two forced cross-file fixes folded in (App config:get fallback literal + config-store ui assertions) from the `ui.defaultShell` schema growth. **Dev-verified `scripts/smoke-agent-config.mjs` CDP 15/15** (AGCF-01/02/03/04/06/07/08 — Settings agents+shell persist, ad-hoc chip+input+spawn-persists-command+registry-untouched, rename trim/no-op-empty, duplicate independence, banner ≥4, tinted tile, stopped `lastOutput` preview) + post-run check: no orphaned `-NoExit`/`/K` agent shells. **PR #44 opened** (`feature/agent-config` → `main`, `Closes #43`) — closes M5. **Remaining (hand-verify only, can ride post-merge):** AGCF-05 remove-worktree confirm (needs a registered workspace + worktree) + visual colour/theme-toggle. (Prior: AM2 agent-sessions PR #41.)

**Prior Current Work:** **M5 AM3 "Agent Config & Integration" — TASKED** (`.specs/features/agent-config/{spec,design,tasks}.md`, AGCF-01..08), awaiting approval to Execute. Closes M5. **11 tasks, 5 phases; test baseline 168 on `main` (AM2's 166 + 2 from merged app-icons/vs2022) → 183** (only T1 `buildRawSpawnPlan` +5 and T4 `SessionManager` grow +10 add units; rest `none` per TESTING.md). All 3 validation tables green; MCP/Skill NONE for every task. Tested seams: T1 pure `buildRawSpawnPlan`, T4 grown `SessionManager` (resolve-from-config / defaultShell / ad-hoc / rename / duplicate / buffer-retention→lastOutput). Phase 3 = 6 parallel disjoint-file leaves (T4 mgr, T6 SettingsDialog, T7 NewSessionDialog, T8 rail, T9 detail+TerminalPane-comment, T10 RemoveWorktreeConfirm); T5 main wiring; T11 App composition + hand-verify. Closes M5. **Design = config + polish over AM2's engine (promote, don't rewrite); only NEW IPC = `sessions:rename` + `sessions:duplicate`.** Registry (`AppConfig.agents[]`, seeded from the demoted `SEEDED_AGENTS` const) + `ui.defaultShell` ride generic `config:patch`; remove-worktree confirm is renderer-orchestrated (`sessions:stop[]` → existing `worktrees:remove`); `lastOutput` rides `SessionView` (no tail IPC). New pure seam `buildRawSpawnPlan` for ad-hoc (raw line, `buildSpawnPlan` untouched). `SessionManager` grows: resolve from `config.agents`, read `config.ui.defaultShell`, retain ring buffer past stop, `rename`/`duplicate`. **Honest finding: AGCF-07 terminal theming already shipped in AM2** — `TerminalPane.readTheme()` already maps full 16-colour ANSI palette + re-emits on toggle (stale "P2 polish" comment); AM3's only new theming = per-agent tile colour (`AgentDef.color`). **Remaining:** approve design → Tasks (likely: config schema + migration verify, `buildRawSpawnPlan`+tests, SessionManager grow+tests, SettingsDialog sections, NewSessionDialog ad-hoc, rename/duplicate UI+IPC, RemoveWorktreeConfirm, concurrency banner, tile colour+preview). Closes M5. (Prior: AM2 agent-sessions.) AM2 shipped (PR #41) and `feature/app-icons` + `feature/vs2022-admin-shortcut` also landed since (not previously logged — both merged into `main`, clean tree). **AM3 scope = 7 of the 8 items AM2 deferred** (4 decisions taken this session): editable agent registry → `AppConfig.agents[]` + Settings dialog (P1); default-shell `pwsh|cmd` (P1); ad-hoc command = **one-shot, not saved** (P1); rename + duplicate (P2); remove-worktree-vs-running confirmation (P2); soft concurrency warning ≥4 + **full ANSI role-palette theming** + **in-memory** last-output preview (P3). **Deferred out of AM3 (user call):** the amber **agent-exited** sub-status + agent-exit detection — no observable signal in a shell-hosted PTY without a sentinel/process-polling (both rejected); status stays running/stopped/path-missing. Preview is in-memory only (buffer dies with the PTY → blank after restart). **Remaining:** approve spec → Design (likely needs design.md: `SEEDED_AGENTS`→`AppConfig.agents[]` migration, new IPC for agents-edit/rename/duplicate/default-shell/remove-confirm, buffer-retain-on-stop, full ANSI theme map). (Prior: AM2 agent-sessions.)

**Prior Current Work:** **M5 AM2 "Agent Sessions" — EXECUTED T1–T14** on `feature/agent-sessions` (12 commits). The AM1 throwaway is gone; the real master-detail Agents direction is in. Promote-don't-rewrite held: `PtyPort`/`buildSpawnPlan`/`emit`/`onSend`/`TerminalPane` reused unchanged. New: `SessionManager` (DI'd Map orchestrator, 13 unit tests) + `SessionRingBuffer` (pure, 8 unit tests) + `src/shared/agents.ts` (`SEEDED_AGENTS` Claude/Copilot/Codex) + AM2 control IPC (`sessions:list/spawn/stop/respawn/remove/attach/detach` + `dialog:pickFolder` + `session:status`). Renderer: `AgentsView` (rail + terminal detail), `SessionRail`/`SessionCard`, `NewSessionDialog`, TopBar Agents segment, + 4 contextual spawn entry points (worktree detail / board card / pinned task 0-1-many / sidebar ctx-menu). **Gate green: typecheck + lint + 166 tests + `electron-vite build`.** Test baseline was actually **145** on `main` (not the 142 the tasks estimated — AM1 PR-review follow-ups added 3); +8 ring-buffer +13 session-manager = **166**. **AGSN-01..05 verified in dev** via `scripts/smoke-agents.mjs` (CDP, **12/12**): Agents segment switches + rail/empty state; New Session dialog shows the 3 seeded agents + browse + Spawn-disabled; spawn N independent running sessions; attach streams `session:data`; typed input round-trips; stop pushes `session:status` stopped while the other keeps running; rail repaints live; remove cleans config. Post-run check: `electron`=0 + 0 `-NoExit` agent-host shells → no orphans (AGSN-04). **Remaining:** (1) the 4 AGSN-06 entry-point *clicks* (worktree-detail/board/tasks/sidebar) are visually unverified — they need registered workspaces; routing is identical (all funnel through `openNewSession`), so low-risk; (2) open PR `feature/agent-sessions` → main (body `Closes #<n>` once the AM2 issue exists). (Prior: AM1 agent spike.)

**Prior Current Work:** **M5 Agent Spike (AM1) — EXECUTED T1–T12** on `feature/agent-spike` (11 commits). The scary stack is **de-risked green**: `node-pty` (N-API prebuilds, no Electron-ABI rebuild needed) + AD-004 streaming IPC (`IpcEvents`/`IpcSends` + `on`/`send`) + `xterm.js` `TerminalPane`, **rebuilt + packaged**. The real Claude Code TUI spawns inside `pwsh` in both `dev` and the **packaged** `win-unpacked` build, streams to xterm, and accepts typed input (verified via `scripts/smoke-agent.mjs` CDP, 3/3); theme recolors live light/dark. electron-builder **auto-unpacked** node-pty — no explicit `asarUnpack` rule needed (design's flagged contingency did not bite). Gate: typecheck + lint (0 errors) + **142** tests (+5 spawn-plan) + `build:win`. Permanent plumbing (`buildSpawnPlan`/`PtyPort`/IPC maps+wrappers+bridge/`TerminalPane`/externalize config) is cleanly separated from the throwaway trigger + inline orchestrator (both annotated `AM1 spike — throwaway, replaced by SessionManager in AM2`). **Remaining:** open PR `feature/agent-spike` → main; then Specify AM2/AM3. (Prior: worktree-name-template)

**Prior Current Work:** worktree-name-template — **EXECUTED T1–T9** on `feature/worktree-name-template`; gate green (typecheck + lint + **137** tests, was 125 → +12). Worktree folder name is now a configurable template (`{repo}`/`{branch}`/`{id}`; default `{repo}-{branch}`), mirroring the branch template: global `ado.worktreeTemplate` (Settings dialog) + per-workspace `.app/config.json` `worktreeTemplate`. Empty render blocks create. Key shape changes: `worktreeNameFor`/templated `worktreePathFor` (`src/shared/worktrees.ts`); `workspaceBranchTemplate`→`workspaceTemplates` (both overrides, one read); IPC `workspaces:branch-template`→`workspaces:templates`; `worktrees:create` gains `worktreeTemplate?`. **Remaining:** open PR (body `Closes #<n>` once the feature issue exists). (Prior: release-cicd T1–T9 executed, T10 manual check pending + PR; v1 roadmap done.)

## Recent Decisions (Last 60 days)

### AD-001: PRD issue #1 and design handoff are the dual sources of truth (2026-06-11)

**Decision:** GitHub issue #1 governs behavior/architecture; `design/handoff/` (README + `Worktree Manager.dc.html`) governs visual fidelity. The `.dc.html` prototype is reference-only, never shipped.
**Reason:** Both artifacts are explicit and detailed; duplicating them into specs would drift.
**Trade-off:** Feature specs stay thinner and reference these artifacts instead of restating them.
**Impact:** Every feature spec links back to PRD user-story numbers and handoff sections.

### AD-002: Roadmap follows the PRD's suggested slice ordering (2026-06-11)

**Decision:** Four milestones — M1 skeleton+sidebar+shortcuts, M2 worktree lifecycle, M3 ADO tasks+start-work, M4 board view+config — matching the PRD's 7-slice ordering.
**Reason:** PRD explicitly notes the app is daily-usable after slice 3 (end of M1); honoring that maximizes early value.
**Trade-off:** ADO integration (the headline feature) lands third, not first.
**Impact:** M1 must ship a polished tree+detail UI since it's used daily before ADO exists.

### AD-003: Skeleton toolchain choices (2026-06-11)

**Decision:** electron-vite 5 via @quick-start/create-electron 1.0.30 template (Electron 39 as pinned by template, React 19, TS 5.9, Vitest 4); JSON config (`%APPDATA%/playground/config.json`); @fontsource for self-hosted fonts; theme via `data-theme` attr.
**Reason:** Template-pinned majors over bleeding edge (registry had Electron 42/TS 6) — stability of a known-good combination.
**Trade-off:** Not on latest Electron; upgrade later if a feature needs it.
**Impact:** `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts` is the IPC growth point; `ConfigStore` takes an injected dir (Electron-free, testable). New features: add channel to contract + `handle()` in main.

### AD-004: Streaming IPC for agent sessions uses typed event + send maps (2026-06-15)

**Decision:** The agent-management feature (PRD #37) introduces the app's first streaming IPC. Rather than a new ad-hoc mechanism, extend the existing typed-contract approach with **two new maps beside `IpcContract`**: `IpcEvents` (main→renderer push — `session:data`, `session:exit`, `session:status`) and `IpcSends` (renderer→main fire-and-forget — `session:input`, `session:resize`). Add typed `on()` / `send()` wrappers as peers to the existing typed `handle()`, and expose `on` + `send` on the preload bridge alongside `invoke`. Control verbs (`sessions:spawn`/`:list`/`:stop`/`:respawn`/`:remove`/`:rename`/`:attach`/`:detach`) stay on the request/response `invoke`/`handle` contract; only the high-frequency PTY byte stream + keystrokes/resize use the push/fire-and-forget channels.

**Reason:** A PTY is a continuous bidirectional firehose — request/response can't model unsolicited output, and per-keystroke `invoke` round-trips are wasteful. Considered and rejected: a **single multiplexed channel** (`{id,type,payload}`) — loses strict per-channel typing, forcing manual union narrowing; and a **MessageChannel per session** — lowest overhead but real port lifecycle/teardown complexity, an over-fit for the throughput of a handful of agent terminals.

**Trade-off:** A little extra typing boilerplate (two map declarations + the `on`/`send` wrappers) versus the multiplexed option's fewer channel names — accepted to keep the codebase's strict per-channel type safety.

**Impact:** `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts` gains `IpcEvents`/`IpcSends` next to `IpcContract`; preload exposes `on`/`send`; main adds typed `on`/`send` helpers beside `handle()`. Per-session scrollback replay rides on `sessions:attach` (replay ring-buffer, then stream) / `sessions:detach` (stop streaming, PTY keeps running). To be promoted to a standalone ADR when `docs/adr/` is established.

## Lessons Learned

- **node-pty 1.1.0 ships N-API prebuilds — no Electron-ABI rebuild needed (2026-06-16, AM1):**
  node-pty 1.1.0 is built on N-API (node-addon-api), so its bundled
  `prebuilds/win32-x64/{pty,conpty,conpty_console_list}.node` are ABI-stable across Node *and*
  Electron — they load unchanged under both. Its loader (`lib/utils.js`) probes `build/Release`,
  `build/Debug`, then `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>`. The packaged app loads from the prebuilds.
  Consequence: the `postinstall: electron-builder install-app-deps` source rebuild is *unnecessary*
  for node-pty and is the only thing that forces a native compile (and fails without a real
  Python — see next lesson). `build:win` does **not** run postinstall, so packaging just reuses
  the prebuilds (`npmRebuild: false` already skips the package-time rebuild).
- **node-pty source rebuild needs real Python + cmd current-dir exec (2026-06-16, AM1):** if a
  source rebuild *is* forced (`install-app-deps`), node-gyp needs a real Python (the Microsoft
  Store `python.exe` stub fails; this machine has none on PATH — used Azure CLI's bundled
  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\python.exe` via `$env:PYTHON`). It then fails again
  inside winpty's `winpty.gyp` (`cmd /c "cd shared && GetCommitHash.bat"`) when the process env has
  `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1` (set in this shell) — cmd refuses to run a `.bat` from the
  current directory ("not recognized"). Clearing that env var lets it build. Both are moot when
  relying on the prebuilds (previous lesson).
- **electron-builder auto-unpacks node-pty — no explicit `asarUnpack` needed (2026-06-16, AM1 / ASPK-05):**
  the design flagged `asarUnpack: node_modules/node-pty/**` as a likely contingency; it was **not**
  required. `electron-builder` smart-detection put the native module under
  `dist/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/node-pty/` (prebuilds `.node` +
  `winpty.dll`/`winpty-agent.exe` + conpty `.dll`/`OpenConsole.exe`), and the **packaged** app loads
  and runs the Claude PTY identically to `dev` (verified by `scripts/smoke-agent.mjs` against
  `win-unpacked` on a CDP port — 3/3 checks, the real Claude banner rendered + keystrokes round-trip).
  The whole AM1 scary stack (native module + AD-004 streaming IPC + xterm, rebuilt + packaged) is
  **de-risked green**. Note: tested `win-unpacked` (byte-identical asar+unpacked layout to the NSIS
  install, just not copied to Program Files); a full Program-Files install was not run to avoid the
  invasive registry/shortcut side effects — loading a `.node` needs read+execute, not write, so the
  read-only-location concern does not change the outcome.
- **electron-builder `-c.*` short overrides break under PowerShell (2026-06-15):** on
  windows-latest (pwsh default) `npx electron-builder ... -c.publish.channel=alpha` is misread
  as a config-file path (`ENOENT .publish.channel=alpha`). bash parses it correctly, so
  `nightly.yml`'s build step pins `shell: bash`. Long form `--config.x=y` also works in pwsh.
- **`gh release edit` has no `--generate-notes` (2026-06-15):** only `gh release create` does, and
  the REST update-release API ignores `generate_release_notes`. So `release.yml` calls the
  *generate-notes* API endpoint, writes the body to a file, then `gh release edit --draft=false
  --notes-file` to publish the electron-builder-created draft with auto notes.
- **electron-builder GitHub publisher always tags `v{version}` (2026-06-15):** it can't target a
  fixed reused tag, so the rolling-single nightly builds with `--publish never` and publishes the
  `nightly` tag via `gh` (SPEC_DEVIATION from the task's `--publish always`).
- **Packaged asar `package.json` keeps source `name` + no `productName` (2026-06-15):** so
  `app.getName()` returns `"playground"` in a packaged build; T6 AUMID is `com.${app.getName()}`.
  Whether nightly gets a channel-distinct identity/userData is unconfirmed — verify in T10; if it
  collides, add `productName`/`name` to source `package.json`. (Tip: `asar extract-file <archive>
  package.json` writes to CWD and silently overwrote the repo's `package.json` — restore via git.)
- **LF must be enforced by the repo, not the clone (2026-06-11):** a fast-forward pull with global `core.autocrlf=true` rewrote the whole working tree as CRLF, exploding `npm run lint` (1781 prettier warnings) on a cold eslint cache. Fixed with `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) + working-tree renormalization. Gates that rely on `eslint --cache` can hide debt — new lint errors surfaced only when the cache went cold.

## Quick Tasks Completed

| #   | Description | Date | Commit | Status |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |

## Deferred Ideas

- [ ] **Agent-activity notifications (v3)** — desktop/in-app alerts on agent-specific events (e.g. "claude finished", "agent is awaiting input"). Pairs with the v3 task→agent auto-briefing. Technical hook: AD-004's PTY target is shell-hosted (the shell auto-runs the agent), so "the agent specifically finished" is not directly observable — completion must be inferred from output patterns or by wrapping the command with a sentinel. Captured during: agent-management grill (PRD #37).
- [ ] All v2 items tracked in PRD "Out of Scope" (terminal hosting, agent management, ADO writes, query feeds) — Captured during: project init
- [x] Bare-ID pin guidance message (`task-board.ts`) now points at the Settings dialog instead of hand-editing `config.json` — resolved while addressing PR #27 review

Components: `buildSpawnPlan` (pure, tested) · `PtyPort` (node-pty shell) · streaming IPC `IpcEvents`/`IpcSends` + `on`/`send` (AD-004) · `TerminalPane` (xterm) · throwaway trigger+orchestrator (no config schema change)

- [x] Tasks AM1 (`.specs/features/agent-spike/tasks.md`) — 12 tasks, 6 phases; only T2 (buildSpawnPlan) is unit-tested, rest `none` (hand-verified OS/IPC/renderer per TESTING.md); all 3 validation tables green. De-risk deliverable = T11 (`build:win` packaged run)
- [x] **Execute AM1 (T1–T12)** on `feature/agent-spike` — ASPK-01..06 all Verified; gate green (142 tests + `build:win`); de-risk findings recorded as STATE.md Lessons (N-API prebuilds; auto-unpack sufficed)
- [x] Open PR `feature/agent-spike` → main (PR #39, merged 2026-06-16)
- [x] **Specify AM2 "Agent Sessions"** (`.specs/features/agent-sessions/spec.md`, AGSN-01..09) — user approved (all 5 entry points; fixed seeded agents Claude/Copilot/Codex, pwsh; ad-hoc/Settings/default-shell/rename/duplicate/concurrency-warn/full-ANSI deferred to AM3)
- [x] **Design AM2** (`.specs/features/agent-sessions/design.md`) — promote-don't-rewrite: delete AM1 throwaway, reuse `PtyPort`/`buildSpawnPlan`/`emit`/`onSend`/`TerminalPane`. New: `SessionManager` (DI'd Map orchestrator, tested w/ mocks like `TaskBoard`) + `SessionRingBuffer` (pure, tested) + `src/shared/agents.ts`. Control IPC set replaces `sessions:spawn`/`:kill`; `session:status` added. **Key call: agent-exit (amber) sub-status DEFERRED to AM3** (user call) — otherwise invisible without a sentinel; AM2 status = running (shell alive) / stopped (shell exited) / path-missing, so `buildSpawnPlan` is reused unchanged. Only the attached session streams; replay rides the data channel; xterm stays the input surface. Design approved.
- [x] **Tasks AM2** (`.specs/features/agent-sessions/tasks.md`) — 14 tasks, 6 phases; only T1 `SessionRingBuffer` (+6) + T4 `SessionManager` (+10) unit-tested → 142→158, rest `none` (shared types via typecheck; thin index.ts wiring + renderer hand-verified per TESTING.md). All 3 validation tables green. Integration deliverable = T10 (first dev run, hand-verify AGSN-01..05); P6 = the 4 contextual entry points. Awaiting approval to Execute.
- [x] **Execute AM2 (T1–T14)** on `feature/agent-sessions` — `SessionRingBuffer`+`SessionManager`+`agents.ts`+AM2 control IPC, `AgentsView`/`SessionRail`/`NewSessionDialog`, spike removed, 4 entry points; gate green (typecheck+lint+166 tests+`electron-vite build`)
- [x] **Hand-verify AM2 in dev** — `scripts/smoke-agents.mjs` CDP 12/12 (AGSN-01..05 + dialog); no orphan shells after stop/quit. AGSN-06 entry-point clicks still visually pending (need registered workspaces)
- [x] Open PR `feature/agent-sessions` → main (PR #41, `Closes #40`)
- [x] **Specify AM3 "Agent Config & Integration"** (`.specs/features/agent-config/spec.md`, AGCF-01..08) — editable agent registry + Settings dialog, default-shell, ad-hoc (one-shot, not saved), rename/duplicate, remove-worktree-vs-running confirm, concurrency warning, full ANSI role-palette theming, in-memory last-output preview. **Amber agent-exited sub-status + detection DEFERRED out of AM3** (no observable signal without sentinel/polling). Awaiting approval to Design.
- [x] **Design AM3** (`.specs/features/agent-config/design.md`) — config+polish over AM2's engine; only NEW IPC = `sessions:rename`/`:duplicate` (registry+shell ride `config:patch`, remove-confirm renderer-orchestrated, `lastOutput` on `SessionView`); new pure `buildRawSpawnPlan` for ad-hoc; `SessionManager` grows (resolve from config, retain buffer past stop). Found AGCF-07 terminal theming already shipped in AM2 → only tile colour is new. Awaiting approval to Tasks.
- [x] **Tasks AM3** (`.specs/features/agent-config/tasks.md`) — 11 tasks, 5 phases; baseline 168 → 183 (T1 `buildRawSpawnPlan` +5, T4 `SessionManager` +10; rest `none`). All 3 validation tables green; MCP/Skill NONE. Awaiting approval to Execute.
- [x] **Execute AM3 (T1–T11)** on `feature/agent-config` — config+polish over AM2's engine; gate green (typecheck + lint + 183 tests + `electron-vite build`); dev-verified CDP 15/15
- [x] Open PR `feature/agent-config` → main (PR #44, `Closes #43`, merged 2026-06-16) — **closes M5**
- [x] `feature/app-icons` → main (PR #42, merged 2026-06-16) — Playground marks replace the default Electron icon
- [x] `docs/repo-presentation` → main (PR #45, merged 2026-06-16) — README rewrite for full feature set + screenshots
- [ ] **AGCF-05 hand-verify** (user-run, post-merge): remove-worktree-vs-running confirm + visual per-agent colour / theme-toggle — needs a registered workspace + worktree
- [x] Specify + Execute agent-task-context (ACTX-01..04) on `feature/agent-task-context` — linked ADO task on agent cards/detail (`linkedPinFor` join) + "Open worktree" jump-to-Tree shortcut; renderer-only, gate green (183 tests)
- [x] Open PR `feature/agent-task-context` → main (PR #47, `Closes #46`)
- [ ] **agent-task-context**: hand-verify in dev post-merge (registered workspace + pinned task matching a worktree branch) — confirm title/pills on card+strip + "Open worktree" lands on VS 2022 launcher
- [ ] **v3 planning** (next): task→agent auto-briefing, agent-activity notifications, ADO writes — all parked in ROADMAP "Future Considerations" / Deferred Ideas
